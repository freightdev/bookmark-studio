# 🖋️ Bookmark Studio — Build Books. Mark Everything.

> A Markdown-native agent design environment for composing books, crafting marks, and authoring memory flows.

## ⚠️ Still in Development

These project is **actively being built**, refined, and soon to be stress-tested in the real world.

* Features may change as I break, test, and rebuild everything from the ground up
* Some logic is experimental or placeholder until it's solid enough for real deployment
* Nothing gets released until it’s strong enough to be trusted by the people it’s built for

If you’re reading this, you’re early.
If you’re using this, you’re part of the build.

## ✨ What is Bookmark Studio?

**Bookmark Studio** is your creative memory lab — a fully local, developer-friendly environment for:

* Writing `.book`, `.mark`, `.marker`, `.page`, `.ribbon`, and `.trail` files
* Linking and previewing how those elements work together
* Composing agents with human-readable stories and memory structure
* Organizing everything into books you can export, test, and publish

Think of it like **Storybook for memory + agents**, designed to be:

* Markdown-first and UI-agnostic
* Compatible with MARK CLI and Bookstore
* Free to use, open to fork, and local-first

## 📘 Core Concepts

| Concept    | Role in Studio                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Book**   | Main workspace file (.book) that stores your project memory |
| **Mark**   | Core memory instruction or logical action unit (.mark)      |
| **Marker** | Connects marks into usable logic flows (.marker)            |
| **Ribbon** | Executable logic ribbon within a book (.ribbon)             |
| **Trail**  | Auto-generated memory of execution (.trail)                 |
| **Page**   | Context snapshot or UI memory (.page)                       |

## 🛠️ What You Can Do

* 📖 Draft `.book` files and split memory into reusable `.page` and `.mark` files
* 🧠 Use visual trail tracking to inspect what happened in your memory structure
* 🪄 Write new markers using reusable blocks, forms, or presets
* 🔄 Share books between other users or export to the `bookstore`
* 💡 Preview real-time memory interaction as you connect pages, marks, and trails

---

## 🧪 Example Flow

1. Create a new book: `driver-onboarding.book`
2. Add pages: `intro.page`, `paperwork.page`, `routes.page`
3. Add marks to trigger steps: `validate-docs.mark`, `assign-route.mark`
4. Link them using a marker: `onboard-driver.marker`
5. Design a ribbon: `fast-onboard.ribbon`
6. Run your book and watch the trail grow

---

## 💼 Use Cases

* Build dispatcher tools with real memory trails
* Draft educational agent books
* Develop ethical workflows with transparent `.trail` logs
* Create toolkits for assistants, models, or embedded agents
