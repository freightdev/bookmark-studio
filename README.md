# 🖋️ Bookmark Studio — Build Books. Mark Everything.

> A Markdown-native agent design environment for composing books, crafting marks, and authoring memory flows.

---

## ✨ What is Bookmark Studio?

**Bookmark Studio** is your creative memory lab — a fully local, developer-friendly environment for:

* Writing `.book`, `.mark`, `.marker`, `.page`, `.ribbon`, and `.trail` files
* Linking and previewing how those elements work together
* Composing agents with human-readable stories and memory structure
* Organizing everything into books you can export, test, and publish

Think of it like **Storybook for memory + agents**, designed to be:

* Markdown-first and UI-agnostic
* Compatible with MARK CLI and Bookstore
* Free to use, open to fork, and local-first

## 📘 Core Concepts

| Concept    | Role in Studio                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Book**   | Main workspace file (.book) that stores your project memory |
| **Mark**   | Core memory instruction or logical action unit (.mark)      |
| **Marker** | Connects marks into usable logic flows (.marker)            |
| **Ribbon** | Executable logic ribbon within a book (.ribbon)             |
| **Trail**  | Auto-generated memory of execution (.trail)                 |
| **Page**   | Context snapshot or UI memory (.page)                       |

## 🛠️ What You Can Do

* 📖 Draft `.book` files and split memory into reusable `.page` and `.mark` files
* 🧠 Use visual trail tracking to inspect what happened in your memory structure
* 🪄 Write new markers using reusable blocks, forms, or presets
* 🔄 Share books between other users or export to the `bookstore`
* 💡 Preview real-time memory interaction as you connect pages, marks, and trails

---

## 🧪 Example Flow

1. Create a new book: `driver-onboarding.book`
2. Add pages: `intro.page`, `paperwork.page`, `routes.page`
3. Add marks to trigger steps: `validate-docs.mark`, `assign-route.mark`
4. Link them using a marker: `onboard-driver.marker`
5. Design a ribbon: `fast-onboard.ribbon`
6. Run your book and watch the trail grow

## 💼 Use Cases

* Build dispatcher tools with real memory trails
* Draft educational agent books
* Develop ethical workflows with transparent `.trail` logs
* Create toolkits for assistants, models, or embedded agents
